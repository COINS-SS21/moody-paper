\abstract{Especially with the current pandemic, presentations via Zoom are part of the daily routine. However, the quality of the presentations, which are mainly used in universities to transfer knowledge, but in widespread areas of the business world, differs greatly and they cannot always guarantee that the knowledge will be passed on. In order to improve the quality in the future, we develop a web application, so that presenters can measure the face and voice emotion of their participants in virtual online meetings, and then evaluate the feedback of the participants.}
